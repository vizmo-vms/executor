## 1.6.2

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1784](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1784) [`55180cb`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/55180cb1487f9a3a28ddc0ee0bedfab8464c1f72) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Build `StorageError.message` from the call-site label plus the driver's error code instead of the driver's raw text. The driver text is drizzle's `Failed query: <sql>\nparams: <bound values>`, so error reporting grouped one storage defect by statement shape and printed bound parameters into issue titles. The full driver error stays on `cause`.

  Add `StorageConnectionError`, a `StorageFailure` variant for postgres.js connection faults (`CONNECTION_ENDED`, `CONNECTION_CLOSED`, `CONNECTION_DESTROYED`, `CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ECONNRESET`) and workerd's cross-request I/O rejection. It carries the fault `code` and a `retryable` flag so a lost socket can be told apart from a pool-lifetime bug.

## 1.6.0

### Patch Changes

- [#1648](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1648) [`a2d1417`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/a2d141758e478274813c8c24d354e1fd0f66af49) Thanks [@baggiiiie](https://github.com/baggiiiie)! - Keep `connections.list` health output compact unless callers opt into diagnostics with `verbose: true`. Default list responses now retain only the health status, identity, and check timestamp; verbose responses continue to include HTTP status, diagnostic detail, and bounded upstream response samples.

## 1.5.42

### Patch Changes

- [#1626](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1626) [`d3f0617`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/d3f0617deec06c57e0d6e1479fe668f79daf977d) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Redact every span header attribute outside a safe allowlist on the hosted HTTP client. The tracer's default four-name blocklist let provider-specific credential headers reach the trace backend verbatim; the hosted client now inverts the model and masks everything except structurally safe negotiation, caching, and tracing headers.

## 1.5.41

### Patch Changes

- [#1580](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1580) [`d572658`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/d572658d74097917412256f10a3ea2e3974f44dd) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: the admin joined user view no longer issues one connection query per subject**

  `admin.listSubjectsWithConnections` read a page of subjects and then queried
  connections once per subject, sequentially. A default page therefore cost 100
  round trips inside a single request, which on a per-request socket dominated
  the response. It now reads the page and then batches every subject's
  connections into one query, so the cost is two queries regardless of page size.
  A subject with no connections still reports an empty array rather than dropping
  out of the page, and the batched read carries the same `owner: "user"` and
  tenant scoping the per-subject read did.

  The `?email=` filter on the admin users endpoints is also applied before the
  read rather than after it: the address resolves to a principal id and that id is
  read directly, instead of paging the tenant and keeping the row that matched.
  Paging still applies to a filtered response, but to the selected row — one row
  at `offset: 0`, empty beyond it.

## 1.5.40

### Patch Changes

- [#1541](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1541) [`8ba64f6`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/8ba64f675f6d6ab5302d4f68390c0b055d006f4a) Thanks [@baggiiiie](https://github.com/baggiiiie)! - Fix a second OAuth connection for the same integration silently overwriting the first instead of being added. Connection names are now normalized consistently: `connectionIdentifier` is idempotent, and the OAuth start flow's free-name guard checks the same normalized name the mint stores, so connecting another account resolves to a distinct suffixed name (e.g. `myGmail2`) instead of re-minting the existing connection.

## 1.5.39

### Patch Changes

- [#1531](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1531) [`6c316c7`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/6c316c77a9efc98784976236852b58c6156e016e) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Revert the hosted outbound DNS guard resolution cache and the accompanying outbound guard changes released in 1.5.38. The guard returns to its previous behavior: no resolution cache, the caller's `redirect` mode is not honored, and `makeHostedHttp` is no longer exported — use `makeHostedFetch` and `makeHostedHttpClientLayer` as before.

## 1.5.38

### Patch Changes

- [#1524](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1524) [`6a924dd`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/6a924dd98de916d6ff8cea2329bf672f149b64f4) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Cache hosted outbound DNS guard resolutions, so a proxied request no longer pays a fresh lookup on every hop. `makeHostedHttp` builds the guarded fetch and the guarded HTTP client layer over one cache; building them separately still works but resolves each hostname twice.

  The outbound guard also honors the caller's `redirect` mode, which it previously ignored: `manual` now returns the unfollowed 3xx with its Location header, and `error` rejects, rather than both silently following the redirect. Redirect method semantics now match platform fetch — a `DELETE` or `PUT` meeting a 301/302, and a `HEAD` meeting a 303, keep their method instead of being rewritten to `GET`, so the request the caller made is the request that goes out. Exhausting the redirect budget rejects rather than handing back the raw 3xx as if it were a final response.

  Address classification is tightened too: the cloud metadata endpoint is now blocked by the address a hostname denotes rather than by one dotted-decimal spelling, so its IPv6 forms (`::ffff:169.254.169.254`, the 6to4 `2002:a9fe:a9fe::`, NAT64) are blocked under `allowLocalNetwork` as well, and a name that merely resolves to it is blocked in that mode too — the resolved-address check now runs whether or not the local network is allowed, with only the metadata rule applied to its answers when it is; IPv6 prefixes that carry an IPv4 destination (IPv4-translatable, 6to4, local-use NAT64) are classified by that destination; deprecated site-local addresses (`fec0::/10`) count as local; every address a hostname resolves to is checked rather than the first; subresource integrity survives a cross-origin redirect; and address forms the platform resolver reads differently from a decimal-only parser (octal octets, a dotted quad in the head of a compressed literal) no longer classify as public.

## 1.5.37

### Patch Changes

- [#1498](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1498) [`657b913`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/657b9135b8b841495b362936bf60bdca998c16eb) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Add anonymous product analytics to the local daemon (CLI + desktop) and self-host: execution counts split by MCP/API plane, toolkit usage, integration add/remove, and artifact usage (created/viewed/updated/deleted, attributed to agent tools vs the console UI), filed under a persisted per-install anonymous id. Opt out with DO_NOT_TRACK or EXECUTOR_DISABLE_ANALYTICS.

## 1.5.36

## 1.5.35

### Patch Changes

- [#1443](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1443) [`1b9b1f1`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/1b9b1f10313834a625a411169ebf83f6181589df) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Re-register a dynamically registered OAuth client when the configured callback URL changes instead of reusing the stale registration. DCR clients now persist the redirect URI they registered with the authorization server (`oauth_client.origin_redirect_uri`), and the per-issuer reuse lookup compares it against the current flow callback — a mismatch (for example after a sandbox recreation moved the callback origin) mints a fresh client rather than pairing the old registration with the new callback, which strict providers reject with `invalid_redirect_uri`. The stale client row is left in place so existing connections keep refreshing through it; clients persisted before this release have no stored redirect URI and continue to be reused as before.

## 1.5.34

### Patch Changes

- [#1422](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1422) [`e2712db`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/e2712dbff98145c5c340832ffbdcb21113b9dd78) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - A token refresh the authorization server definitively rejects (any RFC 6749 error code, not just `invalid_grant`) now surfaces to the sandbox as an `oauth_refresh_failed` auth failure carrying the server's error code and description, instead of being scrubbed to "Internal tool error". `invalid_grant` still classifies as `oauth_reauth_required`. Code-less failures (transport blips) keep retrying as before.

- [#1427](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1427) [`7207347`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/720734756a70b1b4f1564bdf82dc4118e5de2b76) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Apply persisted RFC 6902 overrides to OpenAPI specifications during preview, import, and refresh so upstream documents can be corrected without maintaining a fork. Figma imports automatically narrow OAuth to the scopes supported by its OAuth app configuration.

- [#1425](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1425) [`0c4e9b4`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/0c4e9b49fecb35ad71c92a464c3ea01131ff9d6f) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Preserve an integration's declared OAuth scopes when same-origin authorization-server metadata describes a different authorization or token endpoint.

Previously a
  connection's tools were listed once at create time and never updated unless the
  integration's config changed or a user clicked Refresh, so server-side tool
  changes silently broke invocations.
  - `tools/list` discovery now follows `nextCursor` pagination per the MCP spec,
    so servers with paginated catalogs list completely instead of first-page-only.
  - The client handles `notifications/tools/list_changed` received during a tool
    call and marks the connection's persisted catalog stale; the next tools read
    re-lists from the server.
  - An unknown-tool rejection from the server (protocol error or the reference
    SDK's error envelope) returns a typed `mcp_tool_unknown` failure telling the
    caller to re-list, and marks the catalog stale so it heals on the next read.
  - Remote catalogs now also refresh on read once older than a freshness TTL
    (`ExecutorConfig.toolsSyncTtlMs`, default 15 minutes, `null` to disable),
    covering servers that change tools without notifying.
  - A failed listing (server unreachable, auth not ready) no longer wipes the
    previously persisted catalog; it is kept and retried after the TTL.

  Resolved OpenAPI spec text and GraphQL introspection snapshots are now stored content-addressed in the plugin blob store instead of inline in each integration's stored config. Listing integrations no longer loads multi-megabyte spec blobs it immediately discards, which makes the integrations surface dramatically faster for workspaces with large specs. Existing integrations keep working: rows that still inline a spec resolve unchanged and are rewritten in place the next time they are imported or refreshed.

Versions 1.5.5 and 1.5.6 of the library packages were published directly to npm to fix installs resolving the wrong `fumadb` dependency (the vendored database layer is now scoped as `@executor-js/fumadb`); that fix landed in the repo separately, and this release brings the recorded package versions back in line with npm.
