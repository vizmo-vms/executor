  Every HTTP request gets its own database connection, opened when the request fiber's scope opens and closed when it closes. The middleware that builds a request's execution stack, however, captures the boot fiber's context once at layer-construction time and re-applies it to every request. A captured context carries Effect's current memoization map, and re-applying it replaced the fresh per-request map with the boot one — which every in-flight request in the isolate shares.

  The per-request stack build then memoized itself there. Sequential requests still rebuilt, because the memo entry is released once the request that built it finishes, so the problem was confined to requests that overlap: the second request reused the first one's stack build, and with it the first one's database connection. A request could therefore issue queries on a connection it did not own, and lose that connection mid-flight when the owner finished and closed it — typically surfacing as a failed read after a slow outbound call, on a request that had already read successfully.

  The stack is now built with a request-local memoization scope, so overlapping requests each build their own stack over their own connection. The captured context still carries the long-lived services it exists to carry. The two other per-request provider builds that ran under a captured context — the account provider and the admin-users provider — are built the same way, for the same reason.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1576](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1576) [`6535a74`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/6535a74de4860e376e5a2e273cb2d5a662f98c5c) Thanks [@GeiserX](https://github.com/GeiserX)! - **The CLI's server-connection store is written owner-only, and two of its tests now actually run**

  `~/.executor/server-connections.json` holds live credentials for a hosted server — a bearer token, or an OAuth access token together with its long-lived refresh token, rewritten on every silent refresh. It was created with no explicit mode, so the process umask applied and it landed world-readable (0644 by default). Any other account on the machine — or anything that copies a home directory, such as a backup or a container layer — could read a durable credential until the user ran `executor logout`.

  It is now created `0600` with a follow-up `chmod`, matching what the local-server manifest already does for the sibling secret it keeps under `server-control/`. Both steps are needed: `mode` applies only on create, and the `chmod` covers rewriting a store that already exists with looser permissions — which is the common path here, since the file is rewritten on every token refresh.

  Separately, two tests in `server-profile.test.ts` were written as `it("…", () => Effect.gen(…))`. An `Effect` is not a thenable, so Vitest treated each as passing without ever running its body — a deliberately falsified assertion still passed. They are now `it.effect` and execute for real. No production behaviour was wrong; the tests simply were not checking it.

- [#1579](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1579) [`31e17c7`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/31e17c725f0987f86896519f0626f9c94d39ccb7) Thanks [@GeiserX](https://github.com/GeiserX)! - **The desktop settings store is written owner-only**

  `settings.json` holds `serverProfiles`, which carries a remote server's credential — a bearer token, or a basic-auth username and password — for any "Custom server" the user connects to. `conf` (under electron-store) defaults to `configFileMode: 0o666`, so with no explicit mode the file was created `0644`. On Linux, where `~/.config` is not reliably `0700`, that is readable by every other account on the machine. macOS is protected by `~/Library` being `0700` and Windows by ACLs, so this is primarily a Linux-desktop exposure — but owner-only credential files are already this app's standard: `local-auth.ts` writes `auth.json` at `0o600`, and the sidecar manifest is chmodded the same way.

  One option is sufficient here, rather than the mode-plus-chmod pair used elsewhere: `atomically` chmods the temp inode only when the requested mode differs from its own default, and the atomic rename then carries the tight mode onto an already-loose file. Verified against the installed `conf` — with no option a fresh file lands `0644`; with `configFileMode: 0o600` a fresh file lands `0600` and an existing `0644` file becomes `0600` on the next write.

- [#1582](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1582) [`e8e97c4`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/e8e97c4c008fce702ee07ec0ffe2a8d3e6946a21) Thanks [@GeiserX](https://github.com/GeiserX)! - **An MCP health check no longer reports `healthy` when the connection's credential is missing**

  Rendering skips an auth placement whose value is unresolved — that is the renderer's documented behaviour, and callers own the missing-value policy. The MCP health check had no such policy, so it dialled unauthenticated, and any server that lists tools without auth answered. `discoverTools` succeeding maps straight to `healthy`, so a connection whose credential was gone reported as healthy.

  Health status is the signal telling a user to re-authenticate, which makes `healthy` the one answer it must never give in that state. The check now reports `expired` with the unresolved input names, mirroring the OpenAPI health check, which already did exactly this.

  The MCP tool-invocation path already refused for the same reason. `resolveTools` is deliberately left alone — its own comment records that discovery tolerating unresolved credentials is intended, since an open server lists tools unauthenticated.

- [#1741](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1741) [`62748e8`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/62748e86122b747226c76c2e112c5c4d2b4f7095) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Opt-in per-integration search tools on the MCP surface**

  Connecting with `?search_tools=true` (stdio: `executor mcp --search-tools`) adds one minimally-described `search_<integration>` MCP tool per connected integration, so the integration namespaces reach the model as tool names it can see without calling anything. Each call routes through the same flow as `tools.search({ namespace })` inside `execute`, and the tool list comes from the same inventory the `execute` description shows. Off by default; a clean endpoint URL is unchanged.

- [#1573](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1573) [`45ba141`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/45ba1419b4e33ad10b0856c5fbc40fabc8f6efe1) Thanks [@GeiserX](https://github.com/GeiserX)! - **The MCP connection pool no longer keeps credentials in its cache key**

  A pooled remote MCP session is looked up by a key describing the connection's identity, and that key included the connection's resolved credential values — plus the headers and query params those same secrets had already been rendered into. The key is retained as a `Map` key for the pool's lifetime, so the secret stayed readable in process memory long after the call that needed it had finished, with nothing left to read it.

  The key is now the SHA-256 digest of that identity rather than the identity itself. Reuse is unchanged, because equal identities still produce equal keys, and separation is unchanged too: a rotated access token, a different rendered auth header and a credential carried in a query param each still dial a fresh session instead of reusing one authenticated as somebody else. Hashing the whole identity rather than only the fields known to be sensitive means a field added later is covered without anyone having to remember it carries a secret.

  Nothing reads the key back — the pool only compares it, and it reaches no log, span or error message — so nothing observable changes.

- [#1800](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1800) [`eac13e7`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/eac13e7032c027d866c06728f1d5b634fd9ef7dd) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Idle MCP session runtimes are actually reclaimed**

  The MCP session Durable Object has an idle timeout that disposes a session's execution runtime — the execution engine and its executor closure, the built tool catalog, and a live database handle — once the session has gone quiet. That timeout never ran.

  The session arms an idle alarm on every request. The agents framework independently recomputes the Durable Object alarm from its own schedule table and keep-alive refcount, and when it finds neither it does not leave the alarm alone: it deletes it. It releases the last keep-alive reference at the end of every ordinary tool call, from a `waitUntil` that runs just after the response goes out — so the idle alarm the session had armed moments earlier was erased, and a session that had just served a request was left with no alarm at all. Its runtime then stayed resident until the platform evicted the whole object.

  Durable Objects are colocated many-to-one onto an isolate with a single heap, so runtimes that are never reclaimed accumulate there. When the heap is exhausted the allocation that fails is whichever comes next, anywhere in the isolate — which is why the failure tended to surface from storage rather than from the runtimes that had consumed the memory.

  The idle deadline belongs to the session, not to the framework's scheduler, so it is now re-asserted after the framework has arranged whatever it needs — and only while a runtime is actually resident, since once there is nothing left to reclaim the framework's answer is correct.

  Disposal also now emits a span carrying a per-isolate resident-runtime gauge, alongside the same gauge on runtime build, so the reclaim can be confirmed in production rather than inferred.

  Dynamic OAuth registrations now identify HTTPS callbacks as web applications
  and loopback HTTP callbacks as native applications. This lets strict OAuth
  servers validate Executor's redirect URI against the correct client type.

- [#1570](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1570) [`e66a3d8`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/e66a3d893c948fcccc7fc028870d051cb2d31860) Thanks [@GeiserX](https://github.com/GeiserX)! - **The OAuth popup clears its result out of `localStorage` after handing it over**

  The popup writes its result to `localStorage` as the fallback completion channel, because `postMessage` is severed when a provider's consent page sets COOP and `BroadcastChannel` can be partitioned or raced by the auto-close. Nothing removed that entry afterwards, so the payload — which carries the identity label, an email, and on failure the error preview — stayed parked in the user's browser profile.

  The entry is now cleared once the handover has had time to land, and on `pagehide` as a backstop — the failure page never auto-closes so the user can read the error, and closing it by hand would otherwise cancel the pending timer and strand the entry. This cannot cost a listener the result: a `storage` event captures `newValue` at dispatch, so an opener that has been notified already holds it.

- [#1574](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1574) [`c8bb857`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/c8bb8578c3afdc9731274d9e9abc68d7ce32d9ab) Thanks [@GeiserX](https://github.com/GeiserX)! - **The 1Password service-account token is cleared from the op-js global after each call**

  `@1password/op-js` keeps the service-account token on a module-level CLI instance (`cli.serviceAccountToken`) and reads it when it spawns `op`. The CLI backend set that global before each call and never cleared it, so one reachable reference to the token stayed live for the rest of the process.

  It is now cleared as soon as the call that needed it is done, on success, failure and interruption alike. Authentication is unaffected: every read and write of that global already happens inside the backend's semaphore, so the next operation re-sets the token before it spawns anything.

  This is hygiene rather than a boundary change. No unrelated `op` child ever received a stale token — every call routes through the same critical section that sets the correct one immediately before invoking — and the token is separately persisted in plaintext in the plugin's config blob, so an attacker's reach is unchanged. What it removes is a long-lived reachable reference that nothing needed to keep.

- [#1749](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1749) [`d4afe0c`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/d4afe0c79f146dd169a00988a2d5d0469297be19) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Slim the per-integration `search_<integration>` tool definitions to under half their size: one shared one-line description (the tool name already carries the namespace) and a single bare `query` parameter, dropping the `limit`/`offset` knobs. A session pays for these definitions once per connected integration, so the surface now costs ~2k tokens instead of ~5k at 30 integrations; paging through a namespace belongs in `execute`.

- [#1798](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1798) [`69b0e64`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/69b0e6413737599f11848b3877048f789ca84ac5) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **The packed Worker toolchain is verified at build time, and an incomplete copy is now reported instead of silently ignored**

  `@cloudflare/worker-bundler` cannot live inside the compiled binary: bunfs has no `node_modules`, so a bare specifier is unresolvable there by construction. The build instead copies the package's `dist/` next to the executable and `native-bindings.ts` publishes that path as `EXECUTOR_WORKER_BUNDLER_DIR` for consumers to load from.

  That handoff was described in two places that were free to drift, and did. The build writes `dist/index.bundled.js` — the entry consumers actually load, packed so it has no bare imports of its own — while the runtime check only looked for `dist/index.js` and `dist/esbuild.wasm`. Nothing verified the staged copy after the compile, so a partial staging produced a binary that looked fine on the build machine and failed on the user's, at startup. Worse, the runtime check failed open: when a file was missing it silently declined to set the environment variable, leaving a consumer to fall through to the bare specifier and crash.

  The required file list is now one shared contract used by both sides, so they cannot disagree. The build asserts the staged copy after compiling each target — every required file present, a size floor on the packed entry, and the `\0asm` magic on the wasm so a truncated copy cannot pass — turning a packaging slip into a failed build rather than a broken install. At runtime, a directory that is present but incomplete is reported on stderr naming the missing files, instead of being swallowed. An absent directory stays quiet, since that is the normal non-packaged path.

### Patch Changes

- [#1600](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1600) [`1b5f931`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/1b5f931d90b52fa9eca7b6f53359a117d757c7c1) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Add `integrations.remove` to the core tools so an agent can drop a catalog integration**

  `integrations.list` advertises `canRemove` per integration, but nothing on the agent surface could act on it: removal existed only on the HTTP API and the web console, so an agent that could add an integration could never take one back out. Cleaning up a catalog meant clicking through the UI once per integration.

  The core-tools plugin now contributes `integrations.remove`, taking the `slug` reported by `integrations.list` and cascading to every connection under the integration and the tools those produced. It is approval-gated, being strictly more destructive than `connections.remove`. The `removed` flag is honest rather than always-true: `false` means no catalog row matched, so an already-absent slug and a built-in namespace like `executor` are distinguishable from a real removal, and an integration pinned with `canRemove: false` is refused with `IntegrationRemovalNotAllowedError` instead of silently surviving.

- [#1556](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1556) [`f674fb8`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/f674fb80eebd597f922edd5ec21b8035ab195a78) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: native MCP elicitation now reaches clients on the local HTTP endpoint instead of timing out**

  The local daemon's Streamable HTTP transport ran with `enableJsonResponse: true`, which buffers a `tools/call` into a single JSON body and leaves no open stream for the server to write on. A server-to-client `elicitation/create` raised during that call was therefore never delivered, and approval-gated tools failed with a `-32001` request timeout even though the session had negotiated `elicitation_mode=native` and the client's `elicitation.form` capability. The transport now uses the spec-default SSE streaming, so the reverse request rides the originating tool call's stream — matching the Cloudflare host's behaviour.

- [#1603](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1603) [`624e85f`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/624e85f033632a7624c2bddf0944112166b1f481) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: `oauth.clients.remove` reported success for clients it never removed**

  The tool returned `{ removed: true }` unconditionally. `oauth.removeClient` is idempotent by design at the storage layer — `deleteMany` on a missing row is a no-op, which is the right behaviour for a delete — but the tool mapped that silence to success, so a typo'd slug, an already-deleted client, and the wrong owner were all indistinguishable from a real deletion.

  This bites hardest because clients are keyed by BOTH owner and slug, so the same slug can exist separately under `org` and `user`. An agent sweeping a list of slugs under one hardcoded owner would delete only half of them and report every call as a success, leaving org-owned OAuth apps registered after everything they authorized was gone.

  The tool now checks the caller-visible client set first and returns `removed: false` when nothing matched that `(owner, slug)` pair. The service-level `removeClient` is unchanged and stays idempotent.

## 1.5.37

### Patch Changes

- [#1506](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1506) [`c05a1cf`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/c05a1cfa629b7f28a7d870c584998cb9cbbaf303) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Artifacts are now on by default for MCP connections.** A plain endpoint URL serves the full artifact surface — the artifact tools, the app shell resource, and the artifact skills. Connections that don't want it opt out with `?artifacts=false` (or `--no-artifacts` on the stdio CLI); `?artifacts=true` remains accepted as the explicit default. Previously the surface required a `?artifacts=true` opt-in.

- [#1498](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1498) [`657b913`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/657b9135b8b841495b362936bf60bdca998c16eb) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Add anonymous product analytics to the local daemon (CLI + desktop) and self-host: execution counts split by MCP/API plane, toolkit usage, integration add/remove, and artifact usage (created/viewed/updated/deleted, attributed to agent tools vs the console UI), filed under a persisted per-install anonymous id. Opt out with DO_NOT_TRACK or EXECUTOR_DISABLE_ANALYTICS.

- [#1500](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1500) [`5eb2ca3`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/5eb2ca36f93d2dae6eb8b3506c5de04ca141bb20) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: the artifact migration no longer narrows `definition.name` to varchar(255), which failed on existing long definition names**

- [#1472](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1472) [`1178e3b`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/1178e3b31cd62cd2c05d6504d1586c2d8f018692) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Add an Artifacts tab. Interactive components an agent generates with `render-ui` are saved and listed in the console, and each one has its own page that renders it live — the page an MCP client without MCP Apps support deep-links to. Artifacts can be renamed and deleted from the console, and agents find them again by title.

- [#1505](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1505) [`9bd4a5b`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/9bd4a5b6063bd98f5ae8070baf0dd3ee3e110d68) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Artifact tool results now include the web deep link beside the inline widget payload, not just on the no-apps fallback. Clients can lose a rendered widget in ways the server never sees — a reopened transcript that skips the resource re-read shows raw JSON — and the URL in the result is the model's way to point the user back at the artifact.

- [#1483](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1483) [`54df2e3`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/54df2e3e99509008759269b27484ee6581ce8827) Thanks [@davidwrossiter](https://github.com/davidwrossiter)! - **Fix: GraphQL connections now reject credentials when schema introspection fails and show actionable tool sync diagnostics**

- [#1499](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1499) [`010ea98`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/010ea98e520643731b07e68e21119f12b8ef1505) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: the add-connection wizard no longer wipes a pasted credential when the key check saves a health check mid-flow**

- [#1503](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1503) [`a7c4689`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/a7c468944837cfe097f03f69d612bde31903f284) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: MCP responses larger than Durable Object storage's 128 KiB per-value cap hung the client instead of being delivered**

  The DO transport persisted every outbound message for reconnect replay before writing the live SSE frame, and `storage.put` of an oversize value throws — so a large response (the `ui://executor/shell.html` resource is ~5 MB) was neither stored nor sent, and the client waited on keepalives forever. The transport now delivers the live frame first and treats persistence as best-effort: an oversize message skips the event store with a logged warning and arrives without a replay id, which only costs replayability if the connection drops mid-delivery.

- [#1502](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1502) [`25270b1`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/25270b1f1f091778ba6584e41b041092fc1bdd00) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: MCP clients of the cloud host got a "Shell not built" placeholder as the `ui://executor/shell.html` resource, so every artifact rendered as a widget that never finished loading**

  The deployed Worker has no filesystem, and the shell loader silently fell back to an inert placeholder document when its `fs.readFile` failed. Workers hosts now fetch the built shell through the static-assets binding (the app build emits a stable-named copy alongside the hashed one), the self-host image reads the same emitted asset from its SPA dist, and a host that cannot produce the shell now fails the resource read with an actionable error instead of serving a document that hangs the client. App builds fail if the shell asset was not emitted.

### Patch Changes

- [#1478](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1478) [`8ecbfd6`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/8ecbfd65f2c1393c75661c792723961877866cc5) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Store minted OAuth tokens in the durable file secret store (`auth.json` under `EXECUTOR_DATA_DIR`) instead of the system keychain. On sandbox/headless hosts the keychain can be an in-memory keyring that a stop/recreate wipes, leaving OAuth connections expired with "Stored refresh token could not be resolved." Existing keychain-backed connections migrate with one clean reconnect.

- [#1462](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1462) [`5a70675`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/5a706756c66e53c9a929e9a8c30e57166b8d121b) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix: org OAuth connections on self-host worked only for whoever ran the consent**

  The encrypted-secrets credential provider (the writable provider on the self-hosted and Cloudflare hosts) filed token rows under the _acting user's_ private partition instead of the credential's own owner. An org-owned OAuth connection whose consent completed in one member's browser session therefore resolved only for that member — every other principal failed with `oauth_connection_missing`, while the UI showed the connection healthy. The provider now partitions by the owner embedded in the item id (`oauth:org:…` → org-shared), matching the WorkOS Vault provider, and a boot-time data migration re-files rows already written wrong. The encrypted value itself was never affected.

- [#1459](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1459) [`fc1e589`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/fc1e589613a14750c2ca8c34838a71c758544c8d) Thanks [@wan0net](https://github.com/wan0net)! - Preserve `elicitation_mode=native` when creating self-hosted MCP sessions.

- [#1475](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1475) [`77b0821`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/77b0821ff9bddd6fb419d81a18b9e1af804fdb55) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Refresh OAuth tokens when the upstream rejects them with HTTP 401, not only when the stored expiry says they are due. Connections whose authorization server omits `expires_in` can now recover without a manual reconnect, and the refresh path is traced.

- [#1476](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1476) [`167d899`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/167d899162794064eeac0a755697c2c943f1b9ac) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Remove the custom apps plugin. Git and local-directory app sources are no
  longer supported. The packed binary still ships the workerd and worker-bundler
  sidecars.

A daemon that does fail during boot now exits with the underlying error message instead of hanging with a generic "Unknown error".

- [#1375](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/pull/1375) [`0f81165`](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor/commit/0f81165138c1c987f13ff9839e46539f80b229b0) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Run cloud custom tool bundling in a dynamically loaded Worker so dependency installation and bundling do not share the serving request isolate.

The compiled binary now bundles the 1Password SDK's wasm core correctly and falls back to a copy shipped next to the binary, so vault listing and secret resolution work without the `op` CLI installed.

The release tag beside the `executor` wordmark is now quiet muted-mono metadata instead of a filled pill, matching the registry-minimal design language, and the wordmark is shared across the desktop and dashboard shells so the brand reads identically everywhere. The macOS traffic-light offset is also applied to the mobile sidebar overlay and the collapsed top bar, so the native window controls never sit on top of the wordmark when the window is narrow.

- [#1204](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1204) [`9394217`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/939421733830c78c0be8e7a4c65ea9a7c143abfb) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Fix the self-host and Cloudflare web dashboards showing "update available" even on the latest version. The builds baked a placeholder version (`0.0.0-selfhost` / `0.0.0-cloudflare`) into the shell, so the update check always compared as behind. They now bake the real release version, and the sidebar footer shows the running version so you can see what you are on.

- [#1209](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1209) [`ffa4f70`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/ffa4f700fdba4e3c525f58bbfb0e8355946e29cb) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Fix the desktop and CLI daemon crashing on first launch on Windows when a v1 local database is present. The v1 to v2 data migration performed file operations (fsync, rename, remove) on libSQL SQLite files whose native OS handles linger after close() on Windows, surfacing as a fatal "Unknown error" (EPERM on fsync of a read-only handle, EBUSY on rename/remove of just-closed files). POSIX is unaffected, so this only reproduced on Windows. The migration now opens files read-write for fsync (treating it as best-effort), retries removes the same way renames were already retried, and forces a GC pass on each retry so libSQL's native finalizer releases the handle before the next attempt. Fixes the v1.5.23 Windows startup regression.

Set `EXECUTOR_TEST_AUTO_CONFIRM_BACKGROUND_SERVICE=1` to keep the background service or any other value to decline. When the variable is unset the dialog is shown exactly as before. Native dialogs cannot be answered from CDP or Playwright, so a packaged first-run boot under automation previously blocked at this prompt with no way to proceed.

- [#1199](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1199) [`29936d5`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/29936d5981256f8f953797d9ce8ce073ac6a0b6a) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Fix the desktop app failing to start its local server when the generated auth token begins with a dash. The token is `randomBytes(32).toString("base64url")`, which can start with "-", and the packaged app passed it to the bundled CLI as a separate argument (`--auth-token`, then the token). The CLI then read the leading-dash token as an unknown flag, printed its help, and exited, so the desktop showed a fatal "local Executor server crashed during startup" dialog. This was persistent (the token is saved) and cross-platform, affecting roughly 1 in 64 fresh installs. The token is now passed in the combined `--auth-token=<value>` form so a leading dash is treated as the value.

- [#1199](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1199) [`29936d5`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/29936d5981256f8f953797d9ce8ce073ac6a0b6a) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Notify when a newer Executor is published. The CLI now prints an "update available" line under its ready banner, and the web shell's sidebar update card works for real (a new `/v1/app/npm/dist-tags` endpoint backs it). In the desktop app the card shows a native "Restart to update" action wired to the in-app updater instead of the npm command. The check is best-effort and offline-safe, and can be disabled with `EXECUTOR_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`.

The drag strip now overlays the top of the main area (behind page content) instead of reserving its own row, and the Toolkits header uses a fixed title-bar height so its bottom border aligns with the sidebar header again.

### Patch Changes

- [#1115](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1115) [`92bd86c`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/92bd86cb975ce867b3002ae9bcb6bf60da67cc48) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Google media downloads (Drive file contents, exports, and other binary
  endpoints) are now returned as binary responses instead of being decoded as
  text, so files come back intact. Emit them with `emit(result.data)`.

- [#1115](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1115) [`92bd86c`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/92bd86cb975ce867b3002ae9bcb6bf60da67cc48) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - The CLI now validates that a URL is `http`/`https` before handing it to the
  operating system's browser opener, and on Windows opens it via
  `rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler` instead of `cmd /c start`. This removes a
  path where a crafted URL could be interpreted as a shell command. `executor
login` and the "open in browser" prompts behave the same for normal URLs.

Outbound requests from OAuth token exchanges,
  MCP transports, and GraphQL/Google/Microsoft discovery now all route through the
  guard, and the guard resolves DNS before connecting so a hostname that points at
  a private or loopback address is blocked rather than only literal private IPs.
  This tightens SSRF protection for hosted and cloud execution.

  no credential), which previously failed validation with "Expected exactly one
  provider credential origin". Agents can wire up public, no-auth integrations
  (public MCP servers, public REST APIs) programmatically instead of bouncing
  through the web UI. Templates that take a credential still require exactly one.

  tool's description, so an agent sees the `emit(result.data)` contract before its
  first call instead of only discovering it after a failed attempt or by reading
  `describe.tool`. Non-file tools are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#1076](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1076) [`3e47752`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/3e4775292d75e65fe3fa9ab4101360123b29e27c) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Add `executor login` (plus `logout` and `whoami`) for signing the CLI into a
  hosted or self-hosted Executor server using the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization
  Grant (RFC 8628), instead of manually creating and pasting an API key. `login`
  prints a code and verification URL, opens the browser, and polls; afterwards the
  CLI authenticates with a bearer token. Works against both cloud (WorkOS) and
  self-host (Better Auth) servers.

- [#1076](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1076) [`3e47752`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/3e4775292d75e65fe3fa9ab4101360123b29e27c) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - `connections.list` now returns a lean summary by default, replacing the full
  `oauthScope` grant string (which can run to thousands of characters per
  connection) with an `oauthScopeCount`. Pass `verbose: true` to get the full
  grant back.

- [#1076](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1076) [`3e47752`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/3e4775292d75e65fe3fa9ab4101360123b29e27c) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - The execute result envelope now reports how many items a script sent to the user
  via `emit()`. A script that only emits (with no return value) is no longer
  indistinguishable from one that did nothing: the envelope includes an emitted
  count and a `(no return value; N items emitted to the user)` text preview.

- [#1076](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1076) [`3e47752`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/3e4775292d75e65fe3fa9ab4101360123b29e27c) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Fix OAuth connect for providers that issue authorization codes redeemable only
  at a region-specific token host. Executor now redeems the code at the region
  returned on the callback rather than the statically advertised token endpoint,
  so connecting these providers no longer fails at the token-exchange step.

- [#1076](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1076) [`3e47752`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/3e4775292d75e65fe3fa9ab4101360123b29e27c) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Send a default `executor` User-Agent on OpenAPI tool calls. Upstreams such as
  GitHub that reject requests without a User-Agent (HTTP 403) now succeed instead
  of surfacing the rejection as a credential error. A spec- or connection-provided
  User-Agent still takes precedence.

  the app on a black window. The desktop now re-checks the daemon after install
  failures, falls back to a managed sidecar when the stale daemon disappears, and
  surfaces startup recovery instead of leaving a failed renderer visible.

The desktop app also attaches to a reachable supervised daemon before trusting Windows PID probes, so it no longer starts a competing sidecar when the background service already owns the port.

  platforms, and origin handling is consistent across every host. When
  `EXECUTOR_WEB_BASE_URL` is not set, the server reads the origin a host injects
  (Railway, Render, Fly, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, Azure, Cloudflare Pages) instead
  of defaulting to localhost — so a platform deploy works with zero configuration
  and no longer fails sign-in with "Invalid origin". When the origin still can't be
  determined, that error is replaced with a clear message telling you exactly which
  `EXECUTOR_WEB_BASE_URL` value to set, and a startup warning fires on any non-dev
  deploy that falls back to localhost. The MCP browser-approval link a self-host
  sends to clients now uses the pinned public URL (reachable behind a reverse
  proxy) rather than the server's internal address. These resolution rules now live
  in one shared helper used by every host.

### Patch Changes

- [#1002](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1002) [`64b3544`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/64b3544c297f122fb915ab281f2ac84c766ddcfd) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Fix the self-hosted "Connect an agent" MCP URL. The card printed an
  organization-scoped path (`<origin>/<organizationId>/mcp`) that the
  single-tenant self-host server didn't serve, so connecting an MCP client
  authorized successfully but then failed to reach the tools with an HTTP 404.
  The self-host server now accepts the organization-scoped path and routes it to
  its MCP endpoint.

- [#1002](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1002) [`64b3544`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/64b3544c297f122fb915ab281f2ac84c766ddcfd) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Self-hosted MCP connections now require explicit approval. When an MCP client
  connects, the browser stops on an approval screen showing the connecting
  client's name, what it can access, and that the grant is limited to the MCP
  server (not a web-app login, and it can't make other API calls on your behalf);
  a token is granted only after you Approve. Previously a signed-in user's client
  was authorized automatically with no prompt.

- [#1008](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/1008) [`7237bf2`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/7237bf2a82c2bd435a3a07f7f24338a325d578f0) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Self-hosted instances no longer lose data on restart. Better Auth now shares
  the same libSQL connection as the rest of the instance instead of opening its
  own. Previously the two connections each managed their own write-ahead log on
  the shared database file, and the second one to open could orphan the first —
  so integrations, connections, and tools written after startup landed in a
  discarded log and disappeared on the next restart, while sign-in data survived.
  This is the "reconnected my account but it has zero tools" failure; a single
  shared connection removes the split entirely.

  database rename could hit `EBUSY` (file still held by the just-closed
  SQLite handle or an antivirus scan) and crash the app at boot. The retry
  window now covers the lock instead of giving up after ~2 seconds.

  Also hardens the desktop release pipeline so a hung platform build fails
  fast instead of blocking later releases.

  Upgrading a local database created by an older (v1) release is now resilient to
  interrupted or partially-written upgrade state:
  - The one-time upgrade is recorded in the migration ledger, so it is never
    re-attempted on later boots. Databases that have already upgraded are detected
    from the ledger and skip the upgrade path entirely.
  - Replaying the legacy schema now tolerates a missing or truncated migration
    journal instead of failing to start, so a database left in a half-written
    state from a previous crash boots cleanly.

  - The desktop app now reports crashes from all of its processes (window, main, and the local server sidecar), so launch failures and silent exits become fixable bugs instead of mysteries. Reporting is disabled in local/dev builds and honors `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` as an opt-out.
  - If the local server crashes, the app shows a crash screen with restart and update actions instead of closing silently, and the server's output is persisted to the log file.
  - New **Export Diagnostics** (menu and Settings) zips logs, crash dumps, and a redacted system manifest to Downloads — never secrets or executor data — and **Report a Problem…** prefills a GitHub issue with the diagnostics attached.

- [#964](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/964) [`7cee242`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/7cee242f07687b0d8711201c620d8c61594adc15) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Faster integrations with large API specs**

  Resolved OpenAPI spec text and GraphQL introspection snapshots are now stored content-addressed in the plugin blob store instead of inline in each integration's stored config. Listing integrations no longer loads multi-megabyte spec blobs it immediately discards, which makes the integrations surface dramatically faster for workspaces with large specs. Existing integrations keep working: rows that still inline a spec resolve unchanged and are rewritten in place the next time they are imported or refreshed.

### Patch Changes

- [#943](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/943) [`f485e4a`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/f485e4a23cf3756b9e628cf2d9242fbc0b3da178) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **One auth model across OpenAPI, GraphQL, and MCP**
  - Every protocol plugin now stores the same placements-based auth methods (the new `@executor-js/sdk/http-auth` vocabulary): an API-key method carries any mix of header and query placements, each rendered from its own credential input — so one source can declare OAuth, a bearer-header-plus-team-id-query method, a plain bearer, and a query token side by side, and one connection can carry several values (e.g. both Datadog keys).
  - MCP and GraphQL gain what only OpenAPI could do before: multi-placement methods, query-parameter credentials (servers like ui.sh's `?token=`), and multi-input connections. Rendering, catalog projection, slug normalization, and the React method editor/codec are shared instead of triplicated; the connect modal collects one value per input.
  - Invoking with an unresolvable credential input now fails with `connection_value_missing` (naming the missing inputs) instead of silently dialing unauthenticated.
  - Stored integration configs are rewritten to the canonical shape by a one-off migration: local and self-host run it automatically at startup; cloud operators run `bun run db:migrate-auth:prod` before deploying. Connection bindings and stored credential values are preserved exactly.
  - Authoring: apikey methods are authored in ONE request-shaped dialect on every plugin — it reads like the request it produces: `{ type: "apiKey", headers: { Authorization: ["Bearer ", variable("token")] }, queryParams: { team_id: [variable("team_id")] } }` (`variable()` is exported from each plugin; a plain-string value is a static literal). Inputs normalize to the canonical placements model, which is what stored configs and the catalog read as. Authoring is strict where the renderer is: a value carries at most one variable, as the final part.
  - Every method is keyed by `kind` — OpenAPI's oauth templates re-key from the retired `type: "oauth"` spelling to `kind: "oauth2"` (matching MCP/GraphQL); the one-off migration rewrites stored entries.
  - Breaking (wire): the retired single-placement inputs (`headerName` on MCP, `in`/`name` on GraphQL), raw canonical-placement inputs, and `type: "oauth"` oauth inputs are rejected. The `mcp.addServer` singular `auth` shorthand still works.

- [#950](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/pull/950) [`dbb48ec`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/dbb48ec99e923b15cc39fa5041887566f4a6d2d0) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - **Fix credential sharing for workspace connections**

  Org-shared connections now resolve for every member of a workspace, not only the member who created them. Existing connections are migrated automatically; stored secrets are unaffected.

  - Fixed the Intel mac desktop build failing in CI (the cross-target dependency install was being glob-expanded by the shell).
  - Fixed the first-launch data migration on Windows: renaming the previous database file could hit a transient `EBUSY` while the just-closed SQLite handle was released, so the move now retries briefly instead of failing startup.

  - Fixed the desktop app failing to launch: the packaged sidecar was missing its native SQLite and keychain bindings, so the local server exited before the window appeared. The release pipeline now smoke-tests the compiled sidecar before publishing.
  - Mac auto-updates now serve the correct architecture — the arm64 and x64 update manifests previously collided, so Apple Silicon machines could be offered Intel builds.
  - If the local server fails to start, the app now shows the error (with a pointer to the log) and installs any available update on quit, instead of closing silently.

  **Integrations & auth**
  - Integrations can declare multiple authentication methods in every plugin. MCP servers join the slugged template model used by OpenAPI and GraphQL, so a server can offer OAuth and an API key side by side, and adding a custom method appends instead of replacing a detected one. Existing connections keep working with no migration.
  - OAuth app management is folded into the connect modal, so client setup happens where accounts are added.

- [`c7bb2a4`](https://github.com/RhysSullivan/executor/commit/c7bb2a4da99aac4199b424d6d52e6ea843250e3a) Thanks [@RhysSullivan](https://github.com/RhysSullivan)! - Integrations and connections rework.

  **Highlights**
  - Sources are now split into integrations (the API surface) and connections (the credential). One integration can hold many connections — workspace-shared or personal — and each connection gets its own tool catalog.
  - Tool addresses carry the connection, so agents can target a specific account: `tools.vercel_api.org.workspace.deploy` vs `tools.vercel_api.user.personal.deploy`.
  - Existing data migrates automatically on first launch: sources become integrations, secrets and credential bindings become connections, OAuth apps and tool policies carry over, and the previous database is kept as a backup next to the new one.
  - Public no-auth servers (MCP, GraphQL) connect without entering a credential.
  - Connections display the signed-in identity, so you can tell accounts apart at a glance.
  - The CLI, local web app, and desktop app can connect to a shared Executor server instead of each running their own; the desktop app persists server profiles across restarts.
  - Self-hosted Executor now publishes a multi-architecture GHCR image at `ghcr.io/rhyssullivan/executor-selfhost` (stable releases tagged `latest`, prereleases tagged `beta`).

  **Reliability**
  - OpenAPI, GraphQL, and MCP tools return structured authentication failures with recovery guidance instead of opaque internal errors — covering missing credentials, expired OAuth connections, upstream 401/403 responses, and MCP per-user isolation.
  - OAuth popups complete more reliably in Chrome by preserving the callback channel through the same-origin completion page.
  - OAuth Dynamic Client Registration data is reused across retries and reconnects, including scopes, so providers are not asked to register duplicate clients.
  - Creating a connection with invalid input (no credential for a credentialed method, mixed input origins) returns a clear error with the reason instead of an opaque internal error.
  - The v1 → v2 migration creates connections for no-auth sources, derives OAuth authorize endpoints when v1 only stored a bare issuer origin, keys inline header values per source, and skips malformed credential bindings with a warning instead of silently dropping them. An unreachable OAuth metadata endpoint no longer blocks the migration on launch.
  - Google sources use a bundled OpenAPI flow with valid schemas.
  - MCP tool output schemas match the actual invocation result envelope, including `content`, `structuredContent`, `_meta`, and `isError`.
  - Integration icons survive migration, connected presets show their icons, and credentials show a loading badge while resolving.

  **Breaking changes**
  - Tool addresses gained two segments for the connection's owner and name: `tools.vercel_api.deploy` is now `tools.vercel_api.org.workspace.deploy`. Saved tool policies are rewritten automatically during migration; agent code that hard-codes v1.4 addresses needs the new shape (`tools.search()` returns ready-to-call paths).
  - The Google Discovery plugin was removed. Google integrations now go through the bundled Google flow; existing Google sources migrate automatically.

### Patch Changes
