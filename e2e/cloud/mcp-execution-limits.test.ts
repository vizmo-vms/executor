//
//   - the BALANCE gate consults Autumn's `balances.check` and blocks once an
//     org has used its plan's included executions, and
//   - the RATE-LIMIT backstop counts executions per org per hour and blocks
//     runaway automation even when billing is down.
//
// Both FAIL OPEN: an Autumn error or timeout must never take executions down
// with the billing provider. These scenarios pin all four behaviours end to
// end against the real workerd + McpSessionDO topology, driving a real MCP
// client and reading Autumn's own ledger as ground truth — a blocked execution
// must not reach the meter, and a failed-open one must show the check was
// actually attempted (and faulted) rather than silently skipped.
